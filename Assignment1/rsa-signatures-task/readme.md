First assignment - rsa_part_1.py
When executed, it attacks the plaintext RSA on the server. We choose our own plaintext to sign 'You got a 12 because you are an excellent student! :)'
When done, we get a quote from the server, which is printed to the console.

Second assignment - rsa_part_2.py
When executed, the message 'This is a message that we want to sign with our awesome cryptosystem' is signed, and then the validity of the message and signature is checked.
If the cryptosystem is consistent, "valid signature" is printed - else "inconsistent" is printed.
